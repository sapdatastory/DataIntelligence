Node.js Base Operator
=======
This operator supports custom scripts in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) based on Node.js.
The currently used version is v8.11.4 or later.

Note:
------
In the modeler it is not possible to add additional third-party node-modules. 
You are limited to __@sap/vflow-sub-node-sdk__.

Other modules may or may not work but we do not guarantee this.

For a full featured Node.js development using anything you like, please create an external development project. 
Externally produced operators can be deployed as a vsolution archive.
